# Enhanced Legal RAG System - Complex Question Handling

## üöÄ **What's New:**

### ‚úÖ **English-Only System**
- Removed all Arabic language preferences
- Optimized for English legal documents
- Better English embedding model (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`)

### ‚úÖ **Enhanced for Complex Legal Questions**
- **Smart Chunking**: Splits by articles/sections instead of arbitrary word counts
- **Context-Aware Prompting**: Different prompts for different question types
- **Multi-Step Reasoning**: Breaks down complex legal scenarios
- **Source Attribution**: Shows which articles/pages were used

## üéØ **Handling Complex Questions Like:**

### **"If I did X case then what article should be implemented on me?"**

The system now:
1. **Detects Case Scenarios** - Recognizes "if", "case", "scenario" keywords
2. **Identifies Article Requests** - Looks for "article", "section", "law" terms
3. **Applies Legal Reasoning** - Uses specialized prompt for case analysis
4. **Provides Step-by-Step Analysis**:
   - Identifies relevant articles
   - Explains conditions that trigger each article
   - Determines which specific article applies
   - Provides reasoning for the conclusion

## üîß **Key Improvements:**

### **1. Smart Document Chunking**
```python
# Old way: Split by word count
chunks = text.split()[:500]

# New way: Split by legal structure
article_pattern = r'(Article\s+\d+|Section\s+\d+|Chapter\s+\d+)'
sections = re.split(article_pattern, text)
```

### **2. Enhanced Prompting**
```python
# For case scenarios:
"""
For this case scenario question:
1. First identify the relevant articles/sections that apply
2. Explain what conditions or circumstances trigger each article
3. Determine which specific article(s) would be implemented
4. Provide the reasoning for your conclusion
"""
```

### **3. Better Context Retrieval**
- Retrieves 7 chunks instead of 5
- Includes metadata (page numbers, sections)
- Scores relevance more accurately

## üìã **Requirements for Better Performance:**

### **1. Ollama Model Recommendations:**

**For Legal Documents:**
```bash
# Best for legal reasoning
ollama pull llama3.1:70b  # Most capable for complex legal analysis

# Good alternatives:
ollama pull qwen2.5:32b   # Good for structured reasoning
ollama pull mixtral:8x7b  # Excellent for multi-step analysis
ollama pull codellama:34b # Good for rule-based reasoning
```

**For English Documents:**
```bash
ollama pull llama3.2:8b   # Current default, good balance
ollama pull mistral:7b    # Fast and accurate for English
```

### **2. Hardware Recommendations:**

**Minimum:**
- 16GB RAM
- 8GB VRAM (for larger models)
- SSD storage

**Optimal:**
- 32GB RAM
- 16GB VRAM
- NVME SSD

### **3. Model Configuration:**

Update your Ollama model in the code:
```python
# For better legal reasoning
response = ollama.chat(
    model="llama3.1:70b",  # or mixtral:8x7b
    messages=[{'role': 'user', 'content': prompt}],
    options={
        'temperature': 0.1,    # More precise
        'top_p': 0.9,         # More focused
        'num_ctx': 4096       # Longer context
    }
)
```

### **4. Document Preprocessing:**

**For Legal Documents:**
- Convert Arabic to English if needed
- Ensure clear article/section numbering
- Remove headers/footers that might confuse the system
- Use clean, well-formatted PDFs

## üéØ **Example Complex Questions the System Can Handle:**

1. **Case-Based Questions:**
   - "If someone violates Article 5, what penalties apply?"
   - "In a governance dispute scenario, which articles are relevant?"
   - "What happens if I don't comply with the basic law?"

2. **Implementation Questions:**
   - "How should Article 10 be implemented in practice?"
   - "What procedures must be followed according to Section 3?"
   - "What are the enforcement mechanisms for this law?"

3. **Comparative Questions:**
   - "What's the difference between Article 2 and Article 5?"
   - "Which article takes precedence in case of conflict?"
   - "How do these rules interact with each other?"

## üöÄ **How to Use:**

```bash
cd "d:\INTERNSHIP\pdf_analyzer"
python enhanced_legal_rag.py
```

Then ask complex questions like:
```
‚ùì Question: If I violate the governance rules, what article should be implemented on me?

üìù Answer:
Based on the document analysis:

1. **Relevant Articles Identified**: Article 15 (Violations) and Article 23 (Enforcement)

2. **Conditions that Trigger**: 
   - Article 15 applies when there is a clear violation of governance rules
   - Article 23 applies for the enforcement mechanism

3. **Specific Implementation**: Article 15 should be implemented as it specifically addresses violations of governance rules with appropriate penalties

4. **Reasoning**: The document establishes Article 15 as the primary article for handling violations, with Article 23 providing the enforcement framework.

Sources: Page 8 (Section 3), Page 12 (Section 5), Page 15 (Section 7)
```

## üìä **Performance Tips:**

1. **Use specific questions** - The more specific, the better the answer
2. **Include context** - Mention the type of case or situation
3. **Ask follow-up questions** - Build on previous answers
4. **Use legal terminology** - The system understands legal language better

The enhanced system is now much better equipped to handle complex legal reasoning and case-based questions!
